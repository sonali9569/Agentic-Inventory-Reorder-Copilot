"""
Records real qwen3:4b responses for the fixed demo script into
data/demo_llm_cache.json -- run this once during rehearsal (or whenever the
demo script/dataset changes), then the dashboard's default "cached" mode
replays these instead of depending on a live model call working on stage.

Covers exactly the walkthrough: the graph's reasoning step for the demo date,
and the chatbot questions from run_chatbot_check.py.
