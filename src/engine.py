    Demand rate (mu) and its std (sigma) over the last `window` days.

    A stockout day's units_sold is censored (capped by whatever stock was left),
    not a true zero-demand signal, so those days are excluded by default rather
    than letting them drag the estimate down — falls back to the full window if
    exclusion leaves too little data.

    Be clear about what that exclusion does and does not buy. Dropping censored
    days is a partial mitigation, not a fix: stockouts correlate with demand
    spikes, so deleting them also deletes the high days. That is the classic
    lost-sales selection bias, and it leaves mu biased low on exactly the SKUs
    that stock out most (Umbrella and Raincoat through the monsoon are the worst
    cases here). The statistically correct treatment is to keep those days as
    right-censored observations — demand >= on_hand_start — and fit a censored
    likelihood. A Poisson censored MLE was measured at roughly one further point
    of median accuracy over what this function now does; it is a worthwhile
    follow-up, not a prerequisite. See PROJECT_REPORT.md section 9.

    Estimator is chosen by how sparse the (post-exclusion) series is: once at least
    `intermittent_threshold` of the days are zero, a mean over the raw series is
    dominated by zeros and a median reads 0 outright, so this switches to
