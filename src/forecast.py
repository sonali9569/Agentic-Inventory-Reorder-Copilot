"""
Forecasting and backtest. Fits a per-SKU Prophet model on the festival
calendar and promo regressor, then runs four ordering policies through the same
held-out window against the same true demand, so their outcomes are directly
comparable:

  seller         -- the seller's own gut-feel rule, run closed-loop (the headline baseline)
  actual_replay  -- open-loop replay of the recorded purchase orders, for reference
  plain_rop      -- reorder-point math only: reorder point off a trailing rate, no calendar
  context_aware  -- the same safety-stock term, but sized off the Prophet forecast
                     over the lead-time window instead of a flat trailing rate

All four see only information available as of each simulated day -- the Prophet
model is trained strictly before the backtest window starts, and plain_rop /
context_aware compute their stats from each policy's own observed (censored) sales
so far, never from true_demand_uncensored. That column is the evaluator's oracle,
not a model input.
